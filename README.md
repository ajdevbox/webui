## Figma Design and Analysis

![Figma Design](./mdnotes/figma.png)
I started with inspecting the Figma art work that was supplied and exported the logo and images out and made a mock up on a sperate Figma board to visualise the look and feel across the different screens and devices.

This helps with planning out the HTML structure and the responsive layout

## Flexbox layout

![HTML notes](./mdnotes/layoutplan.png)
I always like to plan out the various div elements that will be required to may basic structure using flex/ grid or a combination of both.  The design that was presented took me a bit of time to get my head around in order to achieve the desired outcome, but after a few tries and looking into the transform rotation documentation gave me a better understanding of how to get the desired outcome


## Html Structure

The whole layout was achieved using a basic wrapper container to house all the other divâ€™s so that they would align correctly and can be targeted using flex box

In the nav section I decided to wrap the nav items (links) in a div labelled box so that I could apply 1 style element to using the transform: rotation to get the desired outcome

## CSS and Responsivness

The following code snippets demonstrate how the responsiveness for the background image was achieved as well as the responsiveness for the other screen devices
